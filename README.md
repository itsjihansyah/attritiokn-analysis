# Attrition Analysis
Company X employs approximately 1300 employees this year. In the previous year, around 15% of these employees left the company, necessitating the replacement of theseemployees with new hires from the job market. This attrition rate is a concern for management due to several reasons:
● Project Delays: The departure of employees leads to delays in ongoing projects, making it challenging to meet deadlines and potentially harming the company's reputation among consumers and partners.
● Recruitment Costs: Maintaining a substantial recruitment department to continuously find and hire new talent incurs significant costs.
● Training Costs: New employees require training and time to acclimate to the company, leading to additional expenses and temporary reductions in productivity.

Given these challenges, it is crucial to understand and model employee attrition to mitigate its impact. The goal of this analysis is to use historical employee data to model attrition using XGBoost with PyCaret, and then apply this model to predict attrition for the current year's employees. The insights gained from this analysis will help HR management make informed decisions to reduce employee turnover and improve retention strategies.
